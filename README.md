# broadlink_sp4_customcomponent
First try for an integration of custom component with added broadlink sp4 support

This is a custom component, and a rough one at that. 

You will get a warning in your log about using an untested custom component,
and MANY posts in you log about status updates from the component worikng. 

This is not really a problem, but maybe not so pretty. 

But it helps any troubleshooting, so until there have been more testing, it will most likely stay for now.
